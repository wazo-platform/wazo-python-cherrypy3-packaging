   - use help2man to generate a manpage for cherryd at build time, since
    one is no longer shipped along with the source code
  * debian/control:
  - add python-nose to Build-Depends, since it's used during the
    documentation build for cross-reference generation

cherrypy3 (3.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Making lintian happy release
  - uploading to unstable
  * debian/control:
  - added ${misc:Depends} to python-cherrypy3's Depends line
  * debian/rules, debian/control:
  - use debhelper 7 instead of cdbs; this rework also makes our
    installation process stop depending on python-support locations
    (Closes: #516144)
  - use quilt for patches
  * debian/README.source:
  - added, to document usage of quilt
  * debian/rules:
  - remove aditional LICENSE.txt file that is being installed
  * debian/rules, debian/python-cherrypy3.dirs, debian/python-cherrypy3.links,
    debian/patches/01_cherryd_location_fix.diff:
  - don't move the tutorial module to the documentation directory, since
    the cherrypy test structure, which is useful, actually wants to have
    it where it is; move the cherryd utility to /usr/sbin; the patch fixes
    where the tests want to run cherryd from
  * debian/python-cherrypy3.doc-base.api:

    - Directory traversal vulnerability in the _get_file_path function
      in filter/sessionfilter.py allows remote attackers to create or
      delete arbitrary files, and possibly read and write portions of
      arbitrary files, via a crafted session id in a cookie
      (CVE-2008-0252).

  * New upstream release
  * debian/watch:
  - updated to understand the new layout of the new download
    source for CherryPy
  * debian/rules:
  - I heartly agree with Sam Clegg on this; the tutorial should be
    in /usr/share/doc/python-cherrypy3, not inside the Python package
    namespace (Closes: #415526)
  * debian/control:
  - updated python-support and python-all-dev version requirements
    and moved them to build-deps because they are needed on clean
  * debian/control, debian/rules, debian/python-cherrypy3.doc-base.api,
    debian/python-cherrypy3.install:

  * debian/README.Debian:
  - added, documenting the Python profiler only being available
    in a non-free package problem
  * debian/rules, debian/python-cherrypy.{postinst,prerm}:
  - install py files to the python-cherrypy instead of cherrypy
    for python-support; using the package name is the correct,
    documented way of doing it.
  * debian/patches/01_auto-reload-with-python-support.diff:
  - removed because python-support >= 0.2, which I depend upon
    provides symlinks for the .py files;
  * debian/control:

  * changed source package name back to something more generic, since
    it seems like there won't be compatibility breakage again anytime
    soon

  - add patch to provide EGG-INFO stuff, so that packages that depend
    on that information, such as TurboGears, will be able to use
    CherryPy
  * debian/patches/auto-reload-with-python-support.diff:
  - auto-reload doesn't like the .py files to be in a different path as the
    pyc files; I need a better solution for this, but for now the auto-reloader
    simply ignores the files in the cherrypy distribution (which is OK, since they
    are not supposed to be modified after the package is installed).
  * debian/control:
  - build-depends on python-setup-tools >= 0.6a9-1, needed to provide the
    EGG-INFO stuff
  * debian/copyright:
  - de-wikify the authors names
  * debian/control, debian/rules:
  - add dummy transition packages for python-cherrypy2.1, and deal with what
    cdbs's python stuff likes to do when it sees lots of python${ver}-module
    packages on the control file =D
